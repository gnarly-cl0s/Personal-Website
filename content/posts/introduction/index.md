# About Me
Welcome to Home Lab Hacker! I'm Carlos Marquez, a cybersecurity professional with a passion for innovation, learning, and sharing knowledge. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in penetration testing, cloud security, and infrastructure management. Through this platform, I aim to share my journey of exploring home lab curiosities, from deploying innovative tools and software to implementing cyber deception techniques that provide real-time insights into threat actors in the wild.

# My Background
I’ve had the privilege of working in roles that blend technical expertise with mentorship and leadership. As a Senior Consultant and Penetration Tester at Coalfire, I specialize in identifying vulnerabilities across various public and private cloud enviornments, as well as  reviewing K8 infrastructure. My experience also includes developing and conducting security training sessions, ensuring compliance with frameworks like PCI DSS and FedRAMP, and spearheading projects involving the latest technologies, such as AI-based LLM audits.

Previously, at Avaya, I focused on secure software development, Kubernetes security, and leading vulnerability disclosure efforts. These roles allowed me to dive deep into areas like threat modeling, risk assessment, and building automated solutions to streamline security practices.

# What You’ll Find Here
Home Lab Hacker is more than just a blog—it's a resource for fellow tech enthusiasts who love diving deep into the technical weeds. Here’s what you can expect:

- SOC Setup Chronicles: Follow my trials and triumphs as I build a fully functional SOC at home, complete with tools for network monitoring, incident response, and threat hunting.
- Cloud Adventures: Insights and tutorials on deploying CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration with Kubernetes, and securing cloud environments.
- Random Tech Endeavors: From scripting and automation to vulnerability scanning and adversary emulation, I’ll share the projects that keep me curious.

# Why I Started Home Lab Hacker
I believe in the power of continuous learning and the importance of community in the tech world. Home Lab Hacker is my way of documenting my journey, sharing the lessons I’ve learned, and connecting with others who share the same enthusiasm for tech innovation.

# My Credentials
I hold certifications including:

- Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
- Offensive Security WiFi Professional (OSWP)
- Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
- Microsoft Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500)
- Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer (GPCSE)

Combined with a degree in Computer Information Security from Cal Poly Pomona, these experiences provide me with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively navigate and adapt to the constantly changing landscape of technology.

# Let’s Connect
When I’m not diving into logs or refining YAML files, I enjoy collaborating with others whenever possible, tackling new challenges, and exploring the latest trends in cybersecurity DevOps and Purple teaming. Feel free to reach out via my LinkedIn or check out my latest experiments on GitHub!
