# Home Lab Hacker
Welcome to Home Lab Hacker! I'm Carlos Marquez, a cybersecurity professional with a passion for innovation, learning, and sharing knowledge. This repository is dedicated to documenting my experince of exploring home lab curiosities, from deploying innovative tools and software to implementing cyber deception techniques that provide real-time insights into threat actors in the wild. 

I decided to learn GO by using Hugo to host a personal static site through cloudflare pages. 

Thank you for visiting Home Lab Hacker! I hope you find the resources and insights shared here valuable and inspiring. Happy hacking!

This website utilizes [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) as the Hugo theme, which I've then customized to my liking.
