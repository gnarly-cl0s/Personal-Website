# a summary about you
summary: 'During the day, I’m a dedicated penetration tester, uncovering vulnerabilities and solving cybersecurity challenges. After hours, I unwind through gaming or dive into experimenting with new tech stacks, deploying them into my home lab environment to explore and learn. Every moment in between is devoted to being a proud father, embracing the balance between family and career. Whether it’s debugging code, spending time with family, or chasing high K/D ratios, I’m driven by curiosity, passion, and a love for growth.'
